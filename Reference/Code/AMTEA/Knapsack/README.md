# Adaptive Model-based Transfer for Knapsack problems

This repository contains the Matlab implementation of our work [Curbing Negative Influences Online for Seamless Transfer Evolutionary Optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326846571_Curbing_Negative_Influences_Online_for_Seamless_Transfer_Evolutionary_Optimization).

We have included six Knapsack problems belonging to six different categories. `GenKnapsack` can be applied to generated new Knapsack problems.

## Usage
To run the code:
```matlab
addpath('../')
demo_KP
```
